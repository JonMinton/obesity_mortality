Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) Obesity and Overweight Prevalence 1980-2015

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015), coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors at the global, regional, national, territorial, and, for a subset of countries, subnational level.

As part of this study, estimates for obesity and overweight prevalence and the disease burden attributable to high body mass index (BMI) were produced by sex, age group, and year for 195 countries and territories. Estimates for high BMI-attributable deaths, DALYs, and other measures (1990-2015) are available from the GBD Results Tool. Files available in this record include obesity and overweight prevalence estimates for 1980-2015. Study results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in June 2017 in "Obesity and Overweight and Their Health Impact 1990-2015 in 195 Countries."
